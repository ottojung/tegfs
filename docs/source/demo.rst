Demo
============

To get a better idea of how TegFS works, you can run a demo and test the file system.

First, navigate to the TegFS directory and run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd tegfs
      $ sh test/test-serve-noauth.sh

This command starts a local TegFS server that you can access at ``http://localhost:8081``

When the server starts, you should see the TegFS welcome page. Click the "here" button to proceed.

.. image:: _static/welcome-page.png
      :alt: TegFS welcome page
      :align: center

This will take you to the TegFS file browser page, where you can view and manage your files.

      :alt: TegFS file browser
      :align: center

Now you can test how TegFS looks and works. You can add, delete, and manage your files using the TegFS file browser.
